## Quick Start

### Basic Memory-Optimized Pipeline

```python
from memory_optimized_pipeline import MemoryOptimizedPipeline

# Create pipeline
pipeline = MemoryOptimizedPipeline(
    batch_size=1000,
    memory_threshold=100 * 1024 * 1024,  # 100MB
    enable_gc_optimization=True
)

# Add processing functions
pipeline.add_processor(lambda x: x * 2)
pipeline.add_processor(lambda x: x + 1)

# Process data stream
def data_generator():
    for i in range(100000):
        yield i

results = list(pipeline.process_stream(data_generator()))
print(f"Processed {len(results)} items")
print(f"Peak memory: {pipeline.stats.memory_peak / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB")
```

### Cache-Aware Pipeline with SIMD

```python
import numpy as np
from cache_aware_pipeline import CacheAwarePipeline

# Create cache-optimized pipeline
pipeline = CacheAwarePipeline(
    chunk_size=8192,  # L1 cache optimized
    enable_simd=True,
    num_threads=4
)

# Add vectorized processors
pipeline.add_processor(lambda data: data * 2.0)
pipeline.add_processor(lambda data: np.sqrt(data))

# Process NumPy arrays
def numpy_data_generator():
    for i in range(100):
        yield np.random.random(1000).astype(np.float32)

results = list(pipeline.process_stream_parallel(numpy_data_generator()))
print(f"Cache hit ratio: {pipeline.metrics.cache_hits / (pipeline.metrics.cache_hits + pipeline.metrics.cache_misses):.2%}")
```

### Asynchronous Pipeline

```python
import asyncio
from async_pipeline import AsyncPipeline

async def main():
    # Create async pipeline
    pipeline = AsyncPipeline(
        max_concurrent_tasks=100,
        batch_size=50
    )
    
    # Add async processors
    async def async_processor(item):
        await asyncio.sleep(0.001)  # Simulate I/O
        return item * 2
    
    pipeline.add_processor(async_processor)
    
    # Generate async data
    async def async_data_gen():
        for i in range(1000):
            yield i
    
    # Process data
    results = []
    async for result in pipeline.process_stream_async(async_data_gen()):
        results.append(result)
    
    print(f"Processed {len(results)} items")
    print(f"Max concurrent tasks: {pipeline.stats.max_concurrent_tasks}")

asyncio.run(main())

## Performance Tips

1. **Choose the Right Pipeline**: Match pipeline type to your workload characteristics
2. **Tune Batch Sizes**: Larger batches improve throughput but increase memory usage
3. **Monitor Memory**: Use built-in metrics to track memory consumption
4. **Profile Your Code**: Identify bottlenecks using the provided benchmarking tools
5. **Scale Gradually**: Start with smaller datasets and scale up based on performance

## System Requirements
