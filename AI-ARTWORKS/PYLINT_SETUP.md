# Pylint Setup and Configuration

## Problem Resolved
The "Pylint client: couldn't create connection to server" error has been fixed by properly configuring Pylint for your project.

## What Was Done

### 1. **Pylint Installation**
- Installed Pylint 3.3.7 in your Python environment
- Added Pylint to project dependencies in `pyproject.toml`

### 2. **Configuration Files Created**

#### `.pylintrc`
- Main Pylint configuration file
- Disables common warnings that are too strict for development
- Sets appropriate line length and naming conventions
- Configures design rules for better code quality

#### `.vscode/settings.json`
- VS Code integration settings
- Enables Pylint linting in the editor
- Configures Python interpreter path
- Sets up automatic formatting and import organization

#### `pyproject.toml` (Updated)
- Added Pylint to development dependencies
- Configured Pylint settings in the `[tool.pylint]` section
- Fixed configuration warnings

### 3. **Setup Script**
- Created `setup_pylint.py` for easy environment setup
- Tests Pylint configuration automatically
- Provides helpful error messages and next steps

## How to Use

### For Development
1. **Restart your IDE/editor** to pick up the new configuration
2. **Open any Python file** - Pylint will now show linting errors
3. **Use the setup script** if you need to reconfigure:
   ```bash
   python setup_pylint.py
   ```

### Manual Pylint Usage
```bash
# Lint a specific file
pylint src/your_file.py

# Lint entire project
pylint src/

# Use specific configuration
pylint --rcfile=.pylintrc your_file.py
```

## Configuration Details

### Disabled Warnings
The following warnings are disabled to reduce noise:
- `C0114` - Missing module docstring
- `C0115` - Missing class docstring  
- `C0116` - Missing function docstring
- `C0103` - Invalid name
- `R0903` - Too few public methods
- `R0913` - Too many arguments
- `R0914` - Too many locals
- `R0915` - Too many statements
- `W0621` - Redefined outer name
- `W0622` - Redefined builtin
- `W0703` - Broad except
- `W0612` - Unused variable
- `W0611` - Unused import
- `W1203` - Logging f-string interpolation

### Design Rules
- Max arguments: 10
- Max locals: 20
- Max returns: 10
- Max branches: 15
- Max statements: 60
- Max parents: 7
- Max attributes: 10
- Min public methods: 0

## Troubleshooting

### If Pylint Still Shows Connection Errors
1. **Restart your IDE completely**
2. **Check Python interpreter path** in VS Code settings
3. **Run the setup script** to verify installation
4. **Check file permissions** on configuration files

### Common Issues
- **"Pylint not found"**: Run `pip install pylint`
- **"Configuration file not found"**: Ensure `.pylintrc` exists in project root
- **"Import errors"**: Check that your Python path includes the project directory

## Integration with Other Tools

### VS Code
- Pylint is automatically enabled
- Errors appear in the Problems panel
- Quick fixes available for common issues

### CI/CD
Add to your CI pipeline:
```yaml
- name: Run Pylint
  run: pylint src/ --rcfile=.pylintrc
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
Add to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: pylint
      name: pylint
      entry: pylint
      language: system
      args: [--rcfile=.pylintrc]
      types: [python]
```

## Next Steps
1. **Test with your existing code** - Open any Python file and check for linting errors
2. **Customize configuration** - Modify `.pylintrc` to match your coding standards
3. **Set up pre-commit hooks** - Automate linting before commits
4. **Configure CI/CD** - Add Pylint to your build pipeline

The Pylint connection issue should now be resolved, and you should see proper linting feedback in your IDE!
