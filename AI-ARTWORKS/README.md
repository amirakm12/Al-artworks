# AI-ARTWORK - AI Creative Studio

🧠 **Next-Level AI Multi-Agent Creative Studio**

AI-ARTWORK is a fully offline, GPU-accelerated, voice-interactive AI creative studio that automates every imaginable image-editing task in one seamless app.

> ⚠️ **Development Status**: This project is currently in early development (alpha). Many features are under active development and may not be fully functional. Contributors and testers are welcome!

## 🚀 Features

### Core AI System
- **Hyper-Orchestrator Agent**: Local quantized LLM (Mixtral, LLaMA 3, Phi-3)
- **Tree-of-Thought Reasoning**: Advanced decision-making with self-correction
- **Real-time Voice Interaction**: Whisper ASR + Bark TTS
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized autonomous sub-agents

### Specialized AI Agents
- **Image Restoration Agent**: Reconstruct damaged/missing parts
- **Style and Aesthetic Agent**: Autonomous image improvement
- **Semantic Editing Agent**: Context-aware editing ("Make it more dramatic")
- **Auto-Retouch Agent**: Face/body recognition and enhancement
- **Generative Agent**: Local diffusion models (SDXL-Turbo, Kandinsky-3)
- **3D Reconstruction Agent**: Image-to-3D conversion with NeRF

### Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.12 + CUDA optimization
- **UI**: Qt6 GPU-accelerated interface
- **Models**: Fully local, offline-capable
- **Privacy**: Zero data leaks, complete local processing

## 🔮 Vision

AI-ARTWORK aims to revolutionize digital image creation and editing by turning months of manual effort into moments of intuitive, natural interaction. Users will simply ask for edits via voice, and advanced multi-agent orchestration will ensure those edits are executed autonomously, accurately, and instantly—all within one ultra-powerful offline app.
