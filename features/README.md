# AISIS Advanced Features

This folder contains stubs and prototypes for advanced features in AISIS, such as:
- Predictive editing
- Federated self-improvement
- Cross-app automation

## Architecture
- Each feature is a separate module, ready for future development.
- Features should be modular, testable, and well-documented.

## Guidelines for Contributors
- Use type hints and docstrings for all public methods.
- Clearly mark TODOs and areas for future work.
- Add tests and usage examples as features mature.
