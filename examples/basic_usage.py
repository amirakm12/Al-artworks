        Deep Learning and Neural Networks
        
        Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks 
        with multiple layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data. 
        It's inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.
        
        Neural Network Basics:
        - Neurons (Nodes): Basic processing units that receive inputs and produce outputs
        - Layers: Collections of neurons that process information at different levels
        - Weights and Biases: Parameters that determine the strength of connections
        - Activation Functions: Functions that determine neuron output (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)
        
        Types of Neural Networks:
        
        1. Feedforward Neural Networks:
        - Information flows in one direction from input to output
