# User Experience Improvements Plan

## 1. Installation & Setup

### One-click Installer
Implemented as scripts/install.sh - a bash script that automates cloning, venv, deps installation, setup, and model download.

### Automatic Dependency Detection
Enhance setup_environment.py to check for missing packages and install them using pip check or similar.

### Model Download Progress Indicators
download_models.py already has progress logging; enhanced with tqdm for console bar in the edit (though edit failed, code provided).

### First-time Setup Wizard
Created src/ui/setup_wizard.py with basic wizard for config and model selection.
Integration code for app_launcher.py proposed but edit failed.

## 2. Monitoring & Analytics

### Usage Analytics (privacy-friendly)
Add local logging of usage metrics to logs/usage.log, opt-in.

### Performance Monitoring
Use psutil to log CPU/GPU usage during tasks.

### Error Tracking
Integrate local error log with stack traces.

### User Feedback System
Add UI dialog for feedback submission to local file or email.

## 3. Accessibility

### Screen Reader Support
Ensure Qt widgets have accessible names and descriptions.

### Keyboard Navigation
Add keyboard shortcuts to UI components.

### High Contrast Mode
Add high contrast theme to ModernThemeManager.

### Internationalization (i18n)
Use Qt's tr() for strings and load translations.
